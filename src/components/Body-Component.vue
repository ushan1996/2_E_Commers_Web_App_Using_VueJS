                <h3 class="text-center">To be able to describe watches, the way people will be able to tell they conditions right away is critical. You do not want to have peoples guessing if there are scratches or dings. There is nothing worst that someone is selling a watch with a description which does not showcase the actual condition of the watch.</h3>
                <p class="text-subtitle-2 text-center">When you are taking pictures of your watch, you should focus on the details of the watch. The better photos you choose, the fewer questions you will get from the potential buyers. If you are trying to take the right pictures, the best way is to take some watch shot during the natural light. Especially right after sunrise or right before sunset. </p>
